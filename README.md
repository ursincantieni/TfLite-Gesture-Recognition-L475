# Gesture recognition using LSM6DSL acc. on STM32

## What?

Firmware to recognize a physical shaking as well as tilting of the device. With this infomation, the board can be used as USB-HID mouse to control the cursor in terms of left-clicking and movement. The gesture recognition is implemented using a Tensorflow Lite model.

Note: "device" refers to the B-L475E-IOT01A discovery kit, for which this project is built.
